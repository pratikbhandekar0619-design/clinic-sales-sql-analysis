# Clinic Sales SQL Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end revenue and collections analysis using MySQL.
It focuses on understanding billing, cash collection, pending payments, and overdue
risk for a clinic.

The dataset used in this project is an anonymized version of real clinic sales data,
ensuring privacy while preserving analytical accuracy.
